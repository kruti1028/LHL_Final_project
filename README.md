## Loan_Eligibility_prediction

### Goal

The goal of the problem is to determine which customers will be able to pay their bills and which
customers will most likely be unable to do so. Clearly, I need to develop a classification
system. Algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests must be used. I
need to develop a model that is accurate and has a low error percentage. The major goal of this
study is to determine whether or not designating a loan to a certain person is safe. In this study, we
use machine learning algorithms such as classification, logic regression, Decision Tree, and
gradient boosting to predict loan data.

### Introduction
This is a loan prediction project. Using a set of variables, I will predict which of the bank's customers are more likely to have their loan application approved. This is a classification problem in Machine Learning, and banks can use these models to assess their customers for loan qualification and fitness.
